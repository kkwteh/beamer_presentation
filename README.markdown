Notes:
  -Neutrino mixing means transistion of one flavor of neutrino into another,
  a phenomenon not contained in the original standard model

  -CKM matrix is a unitary matrix containining information on strength of
  flavor-changing transitions of quarks.

  -PMNS matrix is a unitary matrix with information about strength of various
  interactinos involving leptons.

  -Majorana mass matrix contains information about the mass of neutrinos

Outline of talk.

Section: Intro to NCG and the spectral action.

-Noncommutative geometry is a generalization of Riemannian geometry whose
central object is the spectral triple (A,H,D).

-Definition of Spectral Triple

-Definition of Real Structure

-Example Riemannian manifold

-One of the most import aspects of noncommutative geometry is that one can
construct a unified theory of the standard model with neutrino mixing, minimally
coupled to gravity

-The input required to construct the model is simple, the finite noncommutative
algebra C+H+H+M3C

-One classifies all possible Dirac operators that give a real spectral triple
(A,H,D). The resulting Dirac operators depend on 31 real parameters,
corresponding to the masses for leptons and quarks, angles of CKM and PMNS
matrices and Majorana mass matrix.

-Bosons of standard model, including Higgs are obtained by inner fluctuations of
Dirac operator of geometry.

-From the geometry, one obtains the physics model by applying the spectral
action Tr(f(D/Lambda))

-The spectral action applied to inner fluctuations only gives bosons.

Cosmology
The spectral action, in its non-perturbative form provides a slow-roll potential
whose form and underlying parameters are sensitive to the cosmic topology.

Recipe to construct a gauge theory
  -Choose the gauge group G with NG generators
  -Add NG vector fields (gauge bosons) in a specific representation of the
  gauge group
  -Choose the representation for the matter fields (elementary particles)
  -Add scalar fields to give mass to of the vector bosons
  -Define the covariant derivative and write the most general renormalizable
  Lagrangian, invariant under G, which couples all these fields
  -Shift the scalar fields in such a way that the minimum of the potential is
  at zero
  -Apply the usual techniques of quantum field theory to verify the
  renormalizability and to make predictions
  -Check with Nature
